This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

I'm an Assistant Professor in Economics and Programme Director of the [MSc in Economic Policy](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/postgraduate/msc-econ-policy/) at Trinity College Dublin.
My research focuses on the design of the tax and welfare system, and the evolution and distribution of living standards in Ireland. 

I previously worked as an economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin and the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in London.

I was a member of the Irish Government's 2021-22 Commission on Taxation and Welfare [whose report you can find here](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/7fbeb-report-of-the-commission/).
