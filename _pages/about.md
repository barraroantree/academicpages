I'm an Assistant Professor in Economics and Programme Director of the [MSc in Economic Policy](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/postgraduate/msc-econ-policy/) at Trinity College Dublin.
My research focuses on the design of the tax and welfare system, and the evolution and distribution of living standards in Ireland. 

I previously worked as an economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin and the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in London.

I was a member of the Irish Government's 2021-22 Commission on Taxation and Welfare [whose report you can find here](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/7fbeb-report-of-the-commission/).
