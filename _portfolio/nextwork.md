## Outline
In this project we evaluate the effectiveness of a new Active Labour Market Programme in Denmark using a randomised controlled trial approach. This ALMP – called NExTWORK – seeks to improve economic and educational outcomes of disconnected youth by building work experience through rotating labour market training hosted by a network of companies. The programme has a strong focus on positive youth development activated in highly facilitated peer networks and close support to both participating youth and employers. The RCT is being conducted across 6 municipalities in which eligible youth are randomised either into the NEcTWORK programme or the “status quo” government programme. We plan to utilise administrative register data combined with implementation data to assess whether NExTWORK is more effective at improving the employment and education outcomes and reducing dependence on social assistance and engagement in crime of the participating youth than the status-quo government programme.
