Module outline
======
The issue of market provision and/or state provision provides a central and recurring theme in this module (and in ECU22022). Within each policy area covered, the module investigates market failure and government failure, via for example consideration of externalities, informational problems and an examination of the public choice perspective with respect to possible government failure. Specific topics to be covered include but are not limited to a subset of the following: resource allocation (regulated markets and/or state); taxation; distribution, inequality and poverty; economic growth, employment and unemployment; regulation (e.g. ‘nudging’); care (formal/paid and informal/unpaid); competition; education; health; housing; aging; agriculture; and, energy.
